`sapi help`

# Scaffolding a SakuraAPI project

`sapi init [dir]` where dir is the path to the directory in which you want to initialize the project.

You can also run `sapi init` within a directory and it will initialize the project there.

You can also run `sapi init` over an existing project and it will give you the option to diff changes file by file.

`sapi init` supports setting up the server without authentication, as a JWT issuer and as a JWT audience server.

# Some Caution

`sapi` cli is pretty early in its development. Make sure you have a backup of your files before you use it to update an existing project.
